    "PURPOSE:\n",
    "The Quantum Photonic Array (QPA) acts as the heart of our device. Imagine it as a special net that captures the\n",
    "sunlight brought in by the intake. Instead of just catching the sunlight, the QPA transforms it into something we can\n",
    "use more effectively: excitonic energy. This is the energy of electron-hole pairs which, in simpler terms, are pairs of\n",
    "oppositely charged particles that carry energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "BASIC IDEA:\n",
    "Imagine a room full of mousetraps, and each mousetrap represents a quantum dot in our QPA. When a ball\n",
    "(representing a photon from sunlight) is thrown into the room, it triggers a mousetrap, and the trap captures the\n",
    "ball’s energy. Similarly, when photons from sunlight hit the QPA, the quantum dots ”trap” their energy."
