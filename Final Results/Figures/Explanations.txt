The average wavelength is calculated using the mean of the given constant for minimum and maximum wavelength
The average photon energy is calculated using the equation:

E = (h*c) / λ

where:

E is the energy of the photon
h is Planck's constant
c is the speed of light
λ is the wavelength of the light

Rearranging this formula, the average photon energy is calculated as:

average_photon_energy = (h*c) / average_wavelength

'average_photon_energy' represents the typical energy carried by photons in the given wavelength range
